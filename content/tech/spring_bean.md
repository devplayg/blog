In Spring, the objects that form the backbone of your application and that are managed by the Spring IoC container are called beans. A bean is an object that is instantiated, assembled, and otherwise managed by a Spring IoC container.

imply put, Inversion of Control, or IoC for short, is a process in which an object defines its dependencies without creating them
